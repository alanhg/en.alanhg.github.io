> I love Alfred so much that once I find one of my own efficiency needs, I will study the feasibility of Alfred, and immediately look for third-party or custom development if it is feasible. Until today, I have already developed 16 workflows , and many experience posts, it's a really good experience.


Whether it is self-developed or from third-party , most of them that are being high frequency used. Here to share, may help some friends.
